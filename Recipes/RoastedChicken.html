    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><Strong>Preheat the oven</Strong> to 200°C (400°F).</li>
        <li><Strong>Prepare the chicken</Strong> Pat the chicken dry with paper towels — this helps the skin get crispy. Place it in a roasting pan or on a baking tray.</li>
        <li><Strong>Make the spice rub</Strong> In a small bowl, mix olive oil, salt, pepper, smoked paprika, chili powder, cayenne, garlic powder, onion powder, thyme, and lemon juice.</li>
        <li><Strong>Season generously</Strong> Rub the spice mixture all over the chicken, including under the skin if possible. For extra flavor, stuff the cavity with lemon halves, smashed garlic, and herbs.</li>
        <li><Strong>Roast</Strong> Roast for about 60–75 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 75°C (165°F) in the thickest part of the thigh. If the skin browns too quickly, loosely cover with foil.</li>
        <li><Strong>Rest before carving</Strong> Let the chicken rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing. This keeps it juicy and flavorful.</li>
    </ol>
