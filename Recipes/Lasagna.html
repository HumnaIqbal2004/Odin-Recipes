        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese (divided)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (or 1 teaspoon dried)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the meat sauce</strong>, In a large pan over medium heat, cook the ground beef until browned. Add chopped onion and cook until softened. Stir in garlic and cook for about 30 seconds. Add marinara sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 10–15 minutes to let the flavors develop.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the cheese mixture</strong>, In a bowl, combine ricotta, egg, Parmesan, parsley, and 1 cup of mozzarella. Mix until smooth and well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 180°C (350°F). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Layer the Lasagna</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of the dish.</li>
                <li>Add a layer of lasagna noodles.</li>
                <li>Spread some of the ricotta mixture over the noodles.</li>
                <li>Add a layer of meat sauce.</li>
                <li>Repeat the layers (usually 3 layers total).</li>
                <li>Finish with meat sauce and the remaining 1 cup mozzarella on top.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bake</strong>, Cover with foil (tent it slightly so it doesn’t stick to the cheese) and bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake another 20–25 minutes until bubbly and golden on top.</li>
        <li><strong>Rest before serving</strong>, Let the lasagna rest for 10–15 minutes before slicing. This helps the layers set and makes serving easier.</li>
    </ol>
