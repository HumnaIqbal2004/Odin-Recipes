    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the Meatloaf:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb (450g) ground beef (80/20 for best flavor)</li>
        <li>1 small onion(finely chopped)</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves(minced)</li>
        <li>1 cup breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried parsley (or italian seasoning)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the Glaze</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1-2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mustard(yellow or dijon)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the oven</strong> to 180°C (350°F). Lightly grease a loaf pan or line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix the meatloaf base</strong>, In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, chopped onion, garlic, breadcrumbs, egg, milk, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and parsley. Mix gently with your hands until just combined — don’t overwork it, or the meatloaf can turn dense.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the loaf</strong>Transfer the mixture into your loaf pan or shape it into a loaf on the baking sheet. Smooth the top evenly.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the glaze</strong>, In a small bowl, mix ketchup, brown sugar, and mustard. Spread half of the glaze over the meatloaf.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake</strong> Bake for 40–50 minutes. Remove from the oven, spread the remaining glaze on top, and return to the oven for another 10–15 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 70°C (160°F).</li>
        <li><strong>Rest before slicing</strong>, Let the meatloaf rest for about 10 minutes before slicing. This helps keep it juicy and makes it easier to cut clean slices.</li>
    </ol>
